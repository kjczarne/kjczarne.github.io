[{"content":"C++ is a great language. As much as I hate it I cannot ignore how important it is and how much it brought to the table in it\u0026rsquo;s 36 years of existence. I have tremendous respect for Bjarne Stroustrup for creating the so-called C with classes and I personally think that it\u0026rsquo;s one of the best things that happened in programming language designs around the time when it came to existence.\nBut C++ is a language that we might slowly see becoming legacy technology. Here\u0026rsquo;s my take on the whole C++ shebang.\n üëÄ For context: I started my career as a software developer with JavaScript and Python and then worked with C# for a good few months. I haven\u0026rsquo;t touched C++ until a few months ago simply because I never had a need to. But there are situations in which you will need a much faster language that compiles to native code instead of something that always incurs a massive interpreter overhead. For the past two months I\u0026rsquo;ve been learning C++ with the support of expert developers at work. My view may be a bit simplistic and I\u0026rsquo;d enjoy to start a discussion and hear other views. I made sure it\u0026rsquo;s not my resistance to change that makes me dislike C++ but this article naturally deals with some speculations about the future which we cannot know for certain, hence if you see that I\u0026rsquo;ve overlooked something, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to point it out.\n  üëâ In the examples below I will be using C++17 because that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m using at work. Keep in mind that some of the examples that I describe, e.g. template constraints have been added with the C++20 standard. Why aren\u0026rsquo;t we using C++20? Well, using the latest standard is one of the problems I listed, so read on to learn more.\n The problems with C++ So, let\u0026rsquo;s start with the reasons that I dislike C++. I like to call them genuine problems.\nC++ is extremely verbose Creating production-level code in C++ ofter requires a lot of boilerplate. This is bad because large codebases usually incur higher maintenance costs. On top of that, the syntax of the language doesn\u0026rsquo;t make things better. Take for example the following template declaration which roughly corresponds to a very liberal generic type:\ntemplate \u0026lt;typename T\u0026gt; void do_something(T i) { if constexpr (std::is_integral\u0026lt;uint8_t\u0026gt;(array)) { // ...  } else { // ...  } } Compare that to a generic function in Rust:\nfn do_something\u0026lt;T: u8\u0026gt;(i: T) -\u0026gt; () { // ... } This relative verbosity is prevalent in nearly all constructs. You quickly get sick of std::string make_string_repr(std::shared_ptr\u0026lt;MyClass\u0026gt;, std::string str_template) and you promptly swivel your display from vertical orientation back to landscape (happened to me). In general C++ tends to be way more verbose than languages like Python, though you can learn to make things more concise over time. An expert friend of mine at work once refactored a function I\u0026rsquo;ve created from 70 lines down to about 10. And this is a nice seguey into our next talking point\u0026hellip;\nIt takes years to get proficient in C++ The complexity of the language entails this naturally - you cannot become a good junior developer within a few months. Well, at least if you\u0026rsquo;re average like me, you will make a lot of mistakes especially at the very beginning of your journey. It is an immensely complex language especially for beginners or people comming from higher-level interpreted languages.\nMemory safety is not guaranteed Another issue/feature of C++ is the fact that the developer has to think about memory management very consciously all the time. For example, the following code compiles:\nvoid do_something() { int some_int; // a lot of code ...  int* unknown_int_ptr; // a lot of code ...  int* some_int_ptr = \u0026amp;some_int; } Imagine that between the declaration of the integer and the declaration of the pointer you placed a lot of code and nowhere have you actually assigned a value to the some_int variable. This generally results in so-called undefined behavior, which is basically compiler-dependent and not guaranteed by the standard. So some_int_ptr when dereferenced will point to some_int but we cannot make any guarantees about its value, because it won\u0026rsquo;t make any sense anyway. And this statement is legal in C++ as it is in C.\nNow to the unknown_int_ptr. Notice that it has no address assigned so it essentially is a pointer into nothingness. Again this code compiles. Some smarter compilers might point out that this might be a bug but that depends on the way you\u0026rsquo;ve set up your build toolchain. If you dereference unknown_int_ptr you will actually attempt dereferencing a nullptr which is also undefined behavior and in some cases pretty hard to catch!\nIn Rust, this is explicitly disallowed when using references:\nfn do_something() { let some_int: u8; // won\u0026#39;t compile!  let unknown_int_ptr: \u0026amp;u8; // won\u0026#39;t compile!  let some_int_ptr: \u0026amp;u8 = \u0026amp;some_int; // won\u0026#39;t compile! }  üëÄ The reason why C and C++ do allow such silly operations is to give the developers maximum flexibility with their code. As such, it is the sole responsibility of the developer not to make such mistakes. (Un)fortunately developers are born to make mistakes. Rust takes a middle ground. It is still possible to do unsafe operations in Rust, albeit they need to be explicitly marked (placed in an unsafe { } block).\n  üëÄ Some of the pointer management problems can be averted by using the so-called smart pointers which have been added in C++17. You can even emulate Rust\u0026rsquo;s ownership move logic with std::unique_ptr\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; template. If you\u0026rsquo;re unsure what this all means just disregard this block.\n Using the latest standard might be risky I didn\u0026rsquo;t experience this personally but I\u0026rsquo;ve heard of a commercial project (of which details I cannot disclose) that was implemented in C++17 back when C++17 was a freshly released standard. Long story short, the MSVC Compiler had a bug that caused the developers a lot of headaches before they were able to realize that their code is ok but the compiler is not. You would think that such things are unacceptable but bugs happen in every compiler or interpreter out there. The problem is -\u0026gt; when you\u0026rsquo;re working with a complex language like C++ it\u0026rsquo;s inherently more likely that someone at some point will make a mistake. And that means you have to put lower trust into something as important as the compiler for the language.\nFiguring out build systems is ridiculously complicated My first look at the CMake-based build system generator toolchain in a large commercial project almost made me want to sign up for a 3 month break from work at a mental asylum. Now listen\u0026hellip;\nIn Python we usually need one or more setup.cfg files with a corresponding setup.py that loads it, finds the package files and the package is ready to be installed. Python uses the pip package manager for this, Node.JS has npm or yarn package managers, Rust has its absolutely phenomenal cargo package manager.\n ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è C++ does not have any good package manager whatsoever.\n The closest we have to a package manager in C++ is the Conan package manager. So let\u0026rsquo;s say I want to depend on a few packages in my C++ project. What do I do? I need to nearly write my own build system using CMake and use Conan CMake files to even be able to talk to the package manager when invoking cmake. CMake actually generates Makefile on Linux or Visual Studio Solution files on Windows. Well, not always, depends on how you configure it. Because you could replace Makefile-consuming make with ninja which can also be used as an alternative to MSBuild on Windows, MSBuild being the tool normally responsible for building Solution (*.sln) files. Then you have to remember that cached Conan packages can sometimes interfere with fresh builds if certain configuration options like the version of the compiler has changed in between builds, so does the CMake target directory with its CMakeCacher.txt\u0026hellip; üò£\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a beautiful German adjective that describes this situation perfectly: bescheuert.\n üëâ In Rust to obtain packages necessary for a new project, all you need to do is add them to the list of dependencies in Cargo.toml and trigger a new project build. That\u0026rsquo;s it. That\u0026rsquo;s what dependency management should look like.\n Compiler error messages can be next to useless Last but not least, if you\u0026rsquo;ve ever compiled C++ code in your life you will know what I mean. The output produced by the compiler (especially MSVC) is usually quite uninformative and it often leads you on a wild goose chase. It happened to me lately that when using fmt I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to find an improper usage of a formatter function because the line number info was hidden somewhere in the middle of an outlandishly long stack trace and my eyes just kept on slipping through it. It\u0026rsquo;s often very hard to debug weird compilation errors particularly where macros and templates are used.\nUltimately, why so many problems C++ has so many issues because it\u0026rsquo;s fairly old! Each new standard piled dubious features on top of the existing stuff with regards for maximum backwards-compatibility. Since a path has been taken with many language design choices, it is not really possible to now backtrack on certain decisions. Issues are being fixed and developer experience is being improved, albeit at a much slower pace than for most modern languages.\nWhy I think C++ is heading for the Elysian Fields You might have noticed that all examples I\u0026rsquo;ve provided for the bad stuff in C++, I\u0026rsquo;ve countered with examples in Rust. So, here\u0026rsquo;s my theory:\n üëâ I think Rust will replace C++ as the main systems development low(er)-level language within the next 20 years.\n If the pace of adoption of Rust Programming Language keeps up, we might see Rust being the language that solves some of the issues that C and C++ faced since their conception. Rust is very promising because of:\n An awesome toolchain with the cargo package manager with out-of-the-box documentation builder, unit test runner, childishly simple dependency management, etc. Full memory safety (unless explicitly turned off when you need to). Default immutability -\u0026gt; variables are immutable by default, this way you will e.g. never forget to lock a resource in a thread before using it if it\u0026rsquo;s mutable. Clear, concise syntax -\u0026gt; the syntax is clear, easy to read and above all - concise. Very informative, precise compiler errors and warnings -\u0026gt; many times the compiler suggested an actual solution to the issue I was facing. Speed. It tends to be even faster than C++ in many situations.  Okay but just because I like Rust so much doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean everybody\u0026rsquo;s going to use it. So what indicators do we have at the moment that point to Rust slowly taking the market away from C++? Let\u0026rsquo;s look:\n Rust is now the second officially supported Linux kernel language. Amazon started sponsoring Rust in 2019 under their AWS brand, for example Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Firecracker micro-VM project is implemented in Rust. Microsoft is rewriting some of their projects into Rust. 5th most-wanted programming language of 2020. Named most loved programming language of 2020.  These are all big deals. Linux is the most used operating system in network servers, AWS the most popular cloud provider in the world, Microsoft owns a huge part of the operating system market as well as a good chunk of cloud computing market with its Azure platform. Hence these are all signals that if the pace is kept up, Rust might very well become a go-to for large-scale projects.\nDoes it pay off to learn C++ then? BIG FAT YES. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s a surprise. I go on bashing the language for the entire length of this article and then I drop that bombshell\u0026hellip;\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the harsh inconvenient truth for people who dislike C++: the number of projects implemented in C and C++ to date and the sheer popularity of the language make it impossible to ignore if you want to do low(er)-level development professionally. If you\u0026rsquo;re a freelancer or a startup owner you might enforce Rust, sure, however most companies will still like to leverage troves of C++ talent that is available currently on the market instead of trying to source Rust developers which are still few and far between, albeit growing in numbers by the day.\nAll in all, C++ projects tend to create so much technical debt and tend to be so voluminous that it will take years before Rust can make a massive break. But I sincerely believe that it is the first language on the market that has what it takes to start replacing good old C++ or at least challenge its throne rights.\n","permalink":"http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-21-c-is-the-new-cobol/","summary":"C++ is a great language.

The second most priceless thing is your second brain.\n What I mean by that?\nIf you are able to build a robust reference system with a very short lookup time for any possible piece of information, you will excel at everything you do. The point of being great at your job is not being able to cram everything into your brain and recite formulas or code snippets from memory. If you\u0026rsquo;re able to do this, congratulations you absolutely beautiful savant human being - reach out in comments and please teach me how can I become more like you. If you\u0026rsquo;re average like me, having your little personal Wikipedia would probably help, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve found that Pareto principle definitely applies here and although people out there have created tons of contents about evergreen notes, personal knowledgebases, zettelkasten and second brains, you should start with something simple that has the potential to scale in the future but also be prepared to move your notes elsewhere if your initial choice proves stale for you. Finding the right system for you is always your responsibility and involves you experimenting with different tools before you decide to commit.\nWhat I use I use Obsidian because:\n Ctrl+O brings up a quick-switcher where I can right away see last 10 notes I\u0026rsquo;ve recently opened. Ctrl+P brings up a command pallete that lets me quickly e.g. change from light mode to dark mode when the sun sets. It stores your files as plain Markdown files and you own all your data. You can sync it with their sync service, iCloud Drive, Google Drive, NextCloud, etc. They have a phenomenal iOS application. They have an open plugin system where anybody can develop a community plugin uses elements of the application. I can link and backlink my notes. I can view my notes in a graph view, which lets me discover unexpected connections between concepts. I can create Mermaid.JS graphs directly within the Markdown files, they just rended automatically.  In essence Obsidian gives me:\n Speed -\u0026gt; switching between notes is a matter of split-seconds, search is blazingly fast, I never have to search for commands in ridiculous menus like in OneNote Portability -\u0026gt; not only can I view my notes pretty much on any device but I can also process each note as a plaintext file which means that if I need any automation, it\u0026rsquo;s a matter of writing a basic Python script perhaps using the mistune Markdown parser. Extensibility -\u0026gt; the plugin system means that I can make the experience as complex or as simple as I need. I use among others:  Quick switcher plugin Command pallette plugin Templates plugin Slides plugin Graph plugin Spaced repetition plugin   Privacy -\u0026gt; I get to decide where I store my notes and how I split them up into different vaults. New learning opportunities -\u0026gt; the Spaced Repetition plugin in Obsidian is phenomenal for learning languages with way less useless complexity that comes with Anki flashcards.  How to take notes There are just a handful of rules that I use to make this content aggregation effective:\n  Write big summaries on general topics -\u0026gt; I like to keep e.g. notes on syntax basics for programming languages in a single note that has headings organized into a hierarchy:\n  Write very small, atomic notes on narrower topics -\u0026gt; for example, an article about C++ pointers gets its own page. Whatever feels like a conceptually distinct thing, lands in a different, shorter, more digestible note. Those smaller notes can be then linked together:\n  Link between notes aggressively but be smart -\u0026gt; you should use [[wikilinks]] as much as possible but be smart about it. Obsidian finds unlinked mentions of a particular note which lets you scour through mentions that haven\u0026rsquo;t yet been linked. Decide consciously which of these mentions deserve a link:\n  Treat it like a garden -\u0026gt; your notes should predominantly serve you in the first place. But treating them like ancient scrolls in an old library will not bring you much value. Revise your notes frequently, iterate on different versions, weed out outdated and useless things from your knowledgebase, add and remove content as you see fit. The more you interact with your notes the more value you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to extract out of them. And they will be alive for longer.\n üëÄ If version control is something you\u0026rsquo;re looking for, my suggestion is to learn Git and look nowhere else. I personally do not use any version control system for my knowledgebase. That\u0026rsquo;s because I only care about the state of my knowledge at a single point in time, which is now. I treat my notes not as an end product that needs to have traceable history but as a staging environment that can never be treated as complete and I frankly never needed to roll back changes in my knowledgebase, like I usually do in the codebases I work with. So, do with version control as you please and as you see fit for your own purpose.\n   That\u0026rsquo;s it. That\u0026rsquo;s my 20% of effort that gives me 80% of the desired result, which is being able to get to any meaningful sliver of information within fractions of a second and finding links between pieces of related information.\nAlternatives If Obsidian is perfect for you, stop reading this post now. If you looked at Obsidian and still feel like you need something different, then read on. I did my fair share of experimentation with different solutions, I will also list those that I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried as well.\nAs with pretty much everything on this blog, what follows is an opinion piece and you will find that for some of the products I tried I am pretty opinionated. Treat it as just one person\u0026rsquo;s perspective and feel free to make your own about the tools I mention if you feel they would work for your particular use case.\nWhat I tried and can recommend Notion Notion is very similar to Obsidian with the following differences:\n Your notes are kept in the Notion database on a server somewhere. You don\u0026rsquo;t have direct access to the files. Notion has way more team-oriented features. Notion has unparalleled support for tabular data, much more advanced than Obsidian. Notion has a reasonably large user base and good technical support team.  When should you choose Notion  You need to work with a lot of tabular data. You have little patience for managing files in directories. You find Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s interface less intuitive or if you\u0026rsquo;re not so good with computers. You want to share knowledge for a project with a team and manage tasks in the first place.  Why I stopped using Notion I loved the everything is a page and a heavy reliance on tabular databases since it made looking through e.g. tool collections much easier than in Obsidian. But I found search and quick-switch capabilities to be much more important for me. Both tools support these.\nBut I stopped using Notion because I had little control over the data directly. The representation even after exporting the data isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly 100% Markdown which is a very portable format for content creation and distribution and I wanted to absolutely use it over anything else. Their API rollout was also underwhelming which means I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find integrations with other applications that were meaningful to me and developing those integrations myself just wasn\u0026rsquo;t an option when I realized how convoluted their data model must be.\nAnother issue with Notion is the fact that technically although you own the data, they seem to be unencrypted and Notion employees can actually read your content. I would never feel comfortable placing any sensitive data into my Notion knowledgebase.\nOne feature that sold me on Obsidian over Notion in the end was the ability to display knowledge graphs in Obsidian. Knowledge is non-linear and surprisingly software giants that trade in knowledge management systems (e.g. Notion, Atlassian) seem to ignore this fact as if it was nothing. Working with knowledge as a graph forced me to make my notes more atomic and easier to link together which closely corresponds to the way knowledge is stored in a human brain (at least to the extent we know now).\nFoam Foam is a Visual Studio Code extension that enables you to view knowledge graphs and create wiki-links.\n You get bi-directional links and a graph view very similar to what you get with Obsidian. You can use VSCode for notes which makes a lot of sense if you\u0026rsquo;re using it already for software development. However Foam is pretty simplistic and doesn\u0026rsquo;t go anywhere beyond that. Still in the context of the Pareto principle this might prove to be way more than enough. And the best part: it\u0026rsquo;s entirely open-source and free forever.  What I tried and would not recommend Microsoft OneNote It is fairly good as notetaking software and I used it my entire high-school and 3 years of university before software like Notion or Obsidian started appearing on the market. The biggest issues with OneNote for me:\n Open page concept -\u0026gt; initially I liked the fact that I can click anywhere on the page and arrange content into text-box-like blocks as I please. But for the same reason my notes would always lack consistent structure and one would usually have to scroll over the width and height of the page at the same time to make sense of those huge clumps of information. Abysmal experience while printing pages or exporting to PDF -\u0026gt; I very rarely had to print anything but when I wanted to export my notes to a PDF and share it with other students the output would always be garbled. This issue as far as I know has never been fixed and is related to the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s nearly impossible to represent this open-page format in finitely sized PDF pages. Subpar support for macOS -\u0026gt; I waited years to get the ability to create custom tags in OneNote on a Mac. This is not ok. No Markdown support -\u0026gt; Ctrl+B for bold, Ctrl+I for italics, etc. But then Ctrl+1 for Heading 1, Ctrl+2 for Heading 2\u0026hellip; This is perhaps very nitpicky but hitting ## twice to get the Heading 2 at least doesn\u0026rsquo;t ask me to travel from 1 to 2. My finger automatically lands on the same key when I want to create headings and it\u0026rsquo;s just so much better for muscle memory. It\u0026rsquo;s a shame OneNote doesn\u0026rsquo;t support Markdown. No backlinks -\u0026gt; you get one-way wiki-links. That\u0026rsquo;s it. Clunky interface -\u0026gt; typical Microsoft, i.e. expand a ribbon, click a button, select an option from the menu, click ok\u0026hellip; In Obsidian things like these usually cost two keystrokes. Poor search -\u0026gt; I found the search and quick-switch experience to be vastly subpar to Notion or Obsidian. It\u0026rsquo;s perhaps more about interface than indexing but it just always hampered me from being fast enough.   üëÄ Overall, MS OneNote is a really good notetaking tool but a quite poor choice for full-fledged knowledgebase software.\n Evernote Evernote is one of those riches to rags stories. Back in the days of Evernote with an endless tape and just unparalleled search, tagging and sorting experience it was the closest to organized I have ever been. From my perspective Evernote devolved and became outrageously expensive very quickly.\n Extremely expensive for meager set of features -\u0026gt; I pay 50 euros for the Obsidian commercial license (because I wanted to use it at work, otherwise it\u0026rsquo;s free). For a year of Evernote\u0026rsquo;s Personal plan I\u0026rsquo;d have to shell out about 80 euros. Tries to be everything -\u0026gt; Evernote tries to be your main productivity platform and a notetaking application which makes it good at none of those things. It sports task lists, calendars, reminders, OCR search (admittedly this one is top-notch) and a web clipper. Well but here\u0026rsquo;s the deal, dear Evernote. For tasks and reminders I use MS ToDo, for calendars I use iOS Calendar app or MS Outlook, OCR search is something I maybe used twice in the history of using Evernote itself and I stopped clipping websites in 2012. Links are much more efficient in my humble opinion. Performance issues -\u0026gt; last time I used Evernote it was slow, borderline unusable. Since it\u0026rsquo;s a commercial product this probably has been fixed up until now but just be aware that it might not be the snappiest experience. Yet another proprietary format -\u0026gt; you won\u0026rsquo;t find Markdown here either.  Atlassian Confluence Oh my goodness, where do I start. I cannot believe that this tool is regarded as the professional knowledgebase software for teams. All my experiences with Confluence up until now have been quite unpleasant and the rigidness of the Atlassian stack leaves a lot to be desired.\n Want a plugin? Sure, give me $10000! -\u0026gt; Confluence has a plugin system. Sadly most of the really useful plugins are outrageously expensive because plugin developers have noticed that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of money to make. Confluence\u0026rsquo;s philosophy is far from open-source and free stuff. Want Markdown? How about Confluence Wiki Markup? -\u0026gt; Confluence does not use Markdown. Instead they have their own custom markup language that literally no other tool uses. So now instead of learning one markup language, you need to learn two. Expensive -\u0026gt; $5.50 per user per month. It comes out to about 60 euros per year per user. Arguably, Obsidian commercial license is in the ballpark of 50 euros per computer which is close. Confluence is ok as a basic Wiki software for teams but for what it actually gives you it\u0026rsquo;s a ripoff.  I often jokingly call this disappointing tool Confusence.\nWhat I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried but might work for you  Basecamp -\u0026gt; project management software akin to a combination of Atlassian Confluence and Jira Roam Research -\u0026gt; non-linear notetaking tool with a cult following. Also, quite expensive. Zenkit Hypernotes -\u0026gt; extremely aesthetically pleasing and looks like it\u0026rsquo;s packed with the right number of features but has a hard cap on the limit of notes for almost all of the plans (both free and paid) Fibery -\u0026gt; similar to Notion but with more generative approach to building your own workspace Anytype -\u0026gt; I actually tried it but not enough to formulate a strong opinion about it. It looks similar to Notion but with much more extensible object model, content synchronization using a distributed filesystem (IPFS) and a very reasonable approach to privacy issues. The team also promises that Anytype will always be free and open-source which is absolutely awesome. I tried the early alpha for a short while but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t stable enough to switch to but you should definitely keep an eye on it. Once it\u0026rsquo;s released it might steal a huge chunk of market from tools like Notion.  If you have any other suggestions to try out or if you have other perspectives on the tools I mentioned in the article, feel free to throw in a comment.\n","permalink":"http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-18-the-most-important-piece-of-advice/","summary":"If were to read only one post from this blog and ignore all the others, here is a piece of advice that I would like to give to everyone who wants to vastly improve their career.\n üëâ The most priceless thing that will help you excel in anything you do is your brain.

Python is truly awesome. In C++17 there is no easy way of expressing ranges. In Python an integer range \\(\\langle 0, 4 \\rangle\\) is simply range(0, 5).\nThe syntactic simplicity and high conciseness of the language was originally related to the fact that Python does not have static typing. In Python ducktyping means that you can actually call a function that expects an integer with a string and you will likely only realize at runtime, since there is no compilation step. It makes coding in Python, well\u0026hellip; very easy to begin with but it comes at a huge cost of bugs appearing in production code.\nWhy is this a sin? Actually, let\u0026rsquo;s make it an example:\ndef add_two_ints(x, y): return x + y If we call this like add_two_ints(2, 2), we will get 4.\nWhat will we get if we invoke add_two_ints(2, \u0026quot;lol\u0026quot;)? Is it even possible? Well, kind of. You can call the function but you will get a runtime error:\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: \u0026#39;int\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;str\u0026#39; Adding a 2 to a \u0026quot;lol\u0026quot; string is quite ambiguous and in most cases probably a bug so the interpreter throws an error. But notice that we were able to call the function and there was no type checking happening up to the point of x + y operation.\nIf we tweak this function slightly:\ndef add_two_ints(x, y): print(f\u0026#34;x is {x}, y is {y}\u0026#34;) return x + y The print will run just fine and give us \u0026quot;x is 2, y is 2\u0026quot;! So the input was not checked in any way before the function body has been executed.\nThe example is trivial. But as your code expands, these problems will grow out of control very quickly. We should have a way of controlling the types of input values we\u0026rsquo;re invoking the function with.\nHow to recognize a sinner? Sinners will use bare Python without type hints (which we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss as a solution in the next section) or in the worst instance no facilities for type checking. To make it clearer:\nBad solution The exact example we used originally is a prime example of the worst solution possible:\ndef add_two_ints(x, y): return x + y Slightly better solution A slightly improved variant would actually check the types of arguments at runtime:\ndef add_two_ints(x, y): if type(x) is not int and type(y) is not int: raise ValueError(f\u0026#34;This function accepts only integers as parameters! Called with {x}and {y}\u0026#34;) return x + y However when writing code in any modern editor (e.g. VSCode with Pylance Server or JetBrains PyCharm), the language analyzer will not catch any bad invocations as you write your code. You have to run it to see where it fails and that\u0026rsquo;s suboptimal in terms of development speed and it tends to get very frustrating.\nIf you place the following somewhere else in your code, perhaps in a different module where you import your brand new add_two_ints function:\nadd_two_ints(2, \u0026#34;lol\u0026#34;) Your editor will not tell you that you\u0026rsquo;re using the wrong arguments until you run the script.\nHow to repent? There is one extremely important feature that has been added in Python 3.5 and solves the aforementioned problem: type hints. The advantage of using type hints over bare runtime checking is that you can catch type mismatch issues before you run your code. First you would have to refactor the function slightly:\ndef add_two_ints(x: int, y: int) -\u0026gt; int: if type(x) is not int and type(y) is not int: raise ValueError(f\u0026#34;This function accepts only integers as parameters! Called with {x}and {y}\u0026#34;) return x + y This gives you the following benefits:\n add_two_ints(x: int, y: int) -\u0026gt; int describes the entire signature of the function. Most analysis services like the Python Language Server in VSCode will be able to suggest you what type the input parameters are while you\u0026rsquo;re coding. The aforementioned Language Server will also display a red squiggle under each parameter that is of an unexpected type, hence it will notify you of mistakes like add_two_ints(2, \u0026quot;lol\u0026quot;) while you\u0026rsquo;re coding. You can force every contributor to use type hints where they\u0026rsquo;re required by using static type checkers like pyright by running this in your code acceptance pipelines.  Important question: does this absolve me from runtime parameter checking? Well, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t prevent anyone from still conjuring deamons like add_two_ints(2, \u0026quot;lol\u0026quot;) but at least it will give them a hint if they themselves use something that comes at least close to what VSCode+Pylance can provide.\nIn the end my recommendations would be:\n üëâ Use type hints aggressively. Invest ample time into learning about type aliases, hints for generics, etc. There is a lot of resources out there but if you want a fairly condensed overview, throw in a comment and I\u0026rsquo;ll share my own reference sheet. Good news: it\u0026rsquo;s so easy and intuitive that it will enter your muscle memory within a few days.\n  üëâ Use VSCode with the Pylance Python Language Server. It understands type hints and tells you right away when you\u0026rsquo;re attempting something you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be doing. Or really just use any other IDE or editor that understands type hints.\n  üëâ If you want to be absolutely certain that whoever uses your code doesn\u0026rsquo;t pass a wrong parameter, use runtime type checking and throw informative errors to let the user understand where the error came from.\n  üëÄ Trust me when I say this: you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t believe how many bugs having static type information is able to catch. When you\u0026rsquo;re typing for hours on end you will get tired. You will overlook things. You will get distracted. If you really want high-quality code that will be easier to maintain, use every possibility to be your own adversary and try to catch your own mistakes.\n While it\u0026rsquo;s lately become a controversial topic to exactly quantify how much more catching a bug in production than in development costs, there have been some ridiculous examples of bugs costing companies hundreds of millions of dollars. Pareto principle definitely applies here, putting too many safeguards into your code acceptance pipeline may actually decrease productivity if you go overboard. Type hints however gave me personally the biggest bang for the buck when it comes to code quality assurance, that\u0026rsquo;s why I am so bullish on them.\n","permalink":"http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-17-seven-sins-of-python-sin-3/","summary":"Sin number 3: Unconditional romance with ducktyping Whence the temptation? Python is truly awesome. In C++17 there is no easy way of expressing ranges. In Python an integer range \\(\\langle 0, 4 \\rangle\\) is simply range(0, 5).\nThe syntactic simplicity and high conciseness of the language was originally related to the fact that Python does not have static typing.

If you\u0026rsquo;re fresh to Python, the temptation to create for loops everywhere for lists and dictionaries is immense. Consider a fairly simple example, where we loop over 100000 random integers and we apply a simple mathematical operation to each of those integers. The most straightforward solution would be:\nfor i in random_integers: out_list.append(perform_predefined_calculation(i)) (assumming here that perform_predefined_calculation and random_integer exist)\nA slightly more Pythonic way to express this would be:\nout_list = [perform_predefined_calculation(i) for i in random_integers] Why is this a sin? While it might be ok for small data structures, the problem with all kinds of loops in Python is that they\u0026rsquo;re pretty slow in comparison with functional constructs such as map or filter. Why is that? Python is an interpreted language, so every statement is evaluated at runtime, there is no compilation process. But functions like map and filter were actually implemented in C (well, at least if you\u0026rsquo;re using the most widespread CPython) and C code can be, well\u0026hellip; pretty fast.\nThe test I\u0026rsquo;ve ran showed about 30% performance increase with a simple refactor from a for loop to a list(map(f, x)) idiom.\nYou can do your own timings on your own and modify the examples as you please in this Python notebook.\nHow to recognize a sinner? Our sinners will most likely be individuals less experienced with Python and can be recognized by profilic abuse of loops whenever working with iterable data structures. Every professional will also often use for and less often while, however performance-critical parts of code where a large amount of data is expected will almost always be brimming with the functional idioms.\nHow to repent?  It\u0026rsquo;s okay to use for and while but not where you need fast code. Learn to use at least map, filter and functools.reduce. Refactor code that iderates over large data structures to use the aforementioned functions.  In our particular example, the repentance is easy and gives us code nearly as pretty as the list comprehension used before:\nout_list = list(map(perform_predefined_calculation, random_integers))  üëÄ map applies perform_predefined_calculation function to each element of the random_integers list. map is lazy so it will only run when we iterate over the result at some point. To load the output as a standard Python list, we can simply wrap it into a list() call. The output will be thus exactly the same as originally but we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to obtain it much faster.\n ","permalink":"http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-16-seven-sins-of-python-sin-2/","summary":"Sin number 2: too few optimized functions used This one is pretty common especially for newcomers who have learnt enough about Python to be able to loop over data structures but haven\u0026rsquo;t yet realized how slow Python loops really are.\nWhence the temptation?

I\u0026rsquo;ve also seen this used in actual production code that was deployed to some important clients.\nWhence the temptation?  builtins is a collection of objects that are available from within any Python script and are loaded before any script is executed by the interpreter. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever used int, bytes, dict, list, etc. then these all come from builtins. globals is a collection of objects that exist in current global scope, so objects accessible to any module at a particular point in time when your script is running.   üëâ It is tempting to modify the builtins to expose a particular custom function or object globally to any running Python script without the need to import a module explicitly. Likewise the modification of globals can enable such magic as dynamic imports of modules that are a part of the same package without actually using the explicit module names.\n Why is this a sin? In both cases it makes your code less explicit and modifies global interpreter behavior after builtins or globals have been modified. The implications of this are:\n Nobody understands your code -\u0026gt; you\u0026rsquo;re using symbols that were sneakily imported at some point but no person using your code will be able to easily tell what module they came from and what they do. It often breaks code suggestions -\u0026gt; implicilty imported stuff may not be picked up by language analysis tools that try to determine the validity of statements in your code. It creates a potential for name collisions -\u0026gt; if you were to e.g. define your own map function and then tried adding it to builtins you could inadvertently override a built-in map function. Such blunders are extremely hard to debug.  How to recognize a sinner? The following example function walks two steps into an src submodule and looks for classes that are subclasses of ImportMe and ImportMeToo. It then adds them to globals, which can be used in current scope.\ndef walking_import(): from mod import src for _, name, _ in pkgutil.walk_packages(src.__path__): _temp = importlib.import_module(src.__package__ + \u0026#39;.\u0026#39; + name) for _, n, _ in pkgutil.walk_packages(_temp.__path__): _temp2 = importlib.import_module(_temp.__package__ + \u0026#39;.\u0026#39; + n) for n2, m in inspect.getmembers(_temp2, inspect.isclass): if issubclass(m, ImportMe) or issubclass(m, ImportMeToo): globals()[n2] = m return globals() This is a real function (though slightly redacted) that I once put into production code. A few weeks later we had to change the import sequence in the entire package back to what it used to be because modifying globals made IntelliSense useless and nobody could make sense of the code.\nHow to repent? My advice: never modify globals or builtins. If you find yourself doing that then probably something is fundamentally wrong with the design of your application. If you\u0026rsquo;re a novice make sure to consult your application design with somebody who has more experience. Prefer explicit imports and as little import magic as possible.\n üëÄ Where import magic was usually useful for me was when I wanted to load entire Python scripts as configuration files. Even though I would use importlib and inspect modules for that, I would never touch globals or builtins.\n ","permalink":"http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-10-seven-sins-of-python-sin-1/","summary":"Sin number 1: Do not modify builtins and globals This is one of the biggest no-nos for me and something that I shot myself in the foot at least twice in my career as a Python dev.
