Personally I think it is one of the most unnecessary and dangerous keywords that Python has to offer. I will go one step further and postulate that if you&amp;rsquo;re using nonlocal you&amp;rsquo;re probably doing it wrong.
ðŸ‘‰ The essence of this problem is misunderstanding the purpose or the mechanics of scope in Python.</description></item><item><title>Seven Sins of Python - Sin 4</title><link>http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-27-seven-sins-of-python-sin-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 20:46:12 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-27-seven-sins-of-python-sin-4/</guid><description>Sin number 4: Exception frenzy Python&amp;rsquo;s Exception class is probably one of the most abused and misused features of the language. It&amp;rsquo;s also something that no developer can escape from.
Whence the temptation? An Exception is a pretty natural element of any language. In all languages one will always have some need for a runtime error. In case of Python, most runtime errors inherit from the Exception class. Though technically not a base class (for that would be BaseException), it should be treated like a base class and it often isn&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item><item><title>C++ is the new COBOL</title><link>http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-21-c-is-the-new-cobol/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 22:34:07 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-21-c-is-the-new-cobol/</guid><description>C++ is a great language. As much as I hate it I cannot ignore how important it is and how much it brought to the table in it&amp;rsquo;s 36 years of existence. I have tremendous respect for Bjarne Stroustrup for creating the so-called C with classes and I personally think that it&amp;rsquo;s one of the best things that happened in programming language designs around the time when it came to existence.</description></item><item><title>The Most Important Piece of Advice</title><link>http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-18-the-most-important-piece-of-advice/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 01:59:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-18-the-most-important-piece-of-advice/</guid><description>If were to read only one post from this blog and ignore all the others, here is a piece of advice that I would like to give to everyone who wants to vastly improve their career.
ðŸ‘‰ The most priceless thing that will help you excel in anything you do is your brain. The second most priceless thing is your second brain.
What I mean by that?
If you are able to build a robust reference system with a very short lookup time for any possible piece of information, you will excel at everything you do.</description></item><item><title>Seven Sins of Python - Sin 3</title><link>http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-17-seven-sins-of-python-sin-3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 22:26:21 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-17-seven-sins-of-python-sin-3/</guid><description>Sin number 3: Unconditional romance with ducktyping Whence the temptation? Python is truly awesome. In C++17 there is no easy way of expressing ranges. In Python an integer range \(\langle 0, 4 \rangle\) is simply range(0, 5).
The syntactic simplicity and high conciseness of the language was originally related to the fact that Python does not have static typing. In Python ducktyping means that you can actually call a function that expects an integer with a string and you will likely only realize at runtime, since there is no compilation step.</description></item><item><title>Seven Sins of Python - Sin 2</title><link>http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-16-seven-sins-of-python-sin-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 23:51:37 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-16-seven-sins-of-python-sin-2/</guid><description>Sin number 2: too few optimized functions used This one is pretty common especially for newcomers who have learnt enough about Python to be able to loop over data structures but haven&amp;rsquo;t yet realized how slow Python loops really are.
Whence the temptation? If you&amp;rsquo;re fresh to Python, the temptation to create for loops everywhere for lists and dictionaries is immense. Consider a fairly simple example, where we loop over 100000 random integers and we apply a simple mathematical operation to each of those integers.</description></item><item><title>Seven Sins of Python - Sin 1</title><link>http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-10-seven-sins-of-python-sin-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 23:28:34 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-10-seven-sins-of-python-sin-1/</guid><description>Sin number 1: Do not modify builtins and globals This is one of the biggest no-nos for me and something that I shot myself in the foot at least twice in my career as a Python dev. I&amp;rsquo;ve also seen this used in actual production code that was deployed to some important clients.
Whence the temptation? builtins is a collection of objects that are available from within any Python script and are loaded before any script is executed by the interpreter.</description></item><item><title>Seven Sins of Python - Intro</title><link>http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-10-seven-sins-of-python-intro/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 22:28:34 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://kjczarne.github.io/2021-12-10-seven-sins-of-python-intro/</guid><description>Seven Sins of Python - intro Python is not only the most popular programming language (according to TIOBE as of 2021) but also one of the simplest to work with and easiest to learn. Python is great for a wide range of applications from web development through command line tools to large-scale automation and deep learning projects.
It is far from the snappiest programming languages in terms of performance, however many other languages can be used alongside Python when performance is of essence.</description></item></channel></rss>
