Python is truly awesome. In C++17 there is no easy way of expressing ranges. In Python an integer range \\(\\langle 0, 4 \\rangle\\) is simply range(0, 5).\nThe syntactic simplicity and high conciseness of the language was originally related to the fact that Python does not have static typing. In Python ducktyping means that you can actually call a function that expects an integer with a string and you will likely only realize at runtime, since there is no compilation step. It makes coding in Python, well… very easy to begin with but it comes at a huge cost of bugs appearing in production code.\nWhy is this a sin? Actually, let’s make it an example:\ndef add_two_ints(x, y): return x + y If we call this like add_two_ints(2, 2), we will get 4.\nWhat will we get if we invoke add_two_ints(2, \"lol\")? Is it even possible? Well, kind of. You can call the function but you will get a runtime error:\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str' Adding a 2 to a \"lol\" string is quite ambiguous and in most cases probably a bug so the interpreter throws an error. But notice that we were able to call the function and there was no type checking happening up to the point of x + y operation.\nIf we tweak this function slightly:\ndef add_two_ints(x, y): print(f\"x is {x}, y is {y}\") return x + y The print will run just fine and give us \"x is 2, y is 2\"! So the input was not checked in any way before the function body has been executed.\nThe example is trivial. But as your code expands, these problems will grow out of control very quickly. We should have a way of controlling the types of input values we’re invoking the function with.\nHow to recognize a sinner? Sinners will use bare Python without type hints (which we’ll discuss as a solution in the next section) or in the worst instance no facilities for type checking. To make it clearer:\nBad solution The exact example we used originally is a prime example of the worst solution possible:\ndef add_two_ints(x, y): return x + y Slightly better solution A slightly improved variant would actually check the types of arguments at runtime:\ndef add_two_ints(x, y): if type(x) is not int and type(y) is not int: raise ValueError(f\"This function accepts only integers as parameters! Called with {x} and {y}\") return x + y However when writing code in any modern editor (e.g. VSCode with Pylance Server or JetBrains PyCharm), the language analyzer will not catch any bad invocations as you write your code. You have to run it to see where it fails and that’s suboptimal in terms of development speed and it tends to get very frustrating.\nIf you place the following somewhere else in your code, perhaps in a different module where you import your brand new add_two_ints function:\nadd_two_ints(2, \"lol\") Your editor will not tell you that you’re using the wrong arguments until you run the script.\nHow to repent? There is one extremely important feature that has been added in Python 3.5 and solves the aforementioned problem: type hints. The advantage of using type hints over bare runtime checking is that you can catch type mismatch issues before you run your code. First you would have to refactor the function slightly:\ndef add_two_ints(x: int, y: int) -\u003e int: if type(x) is not int and type(y) is not int: raise ValueError(f\"This function accepts only integers as parameters! Called with {x} and {y}\") return x + y This gives you the following benefits:\nadd_two_ints(x: int, y: int) -\u003e int describes the entire signature of the function. Most analysis services like the Python Language Server in VSCode will be able to suggest you what type the input parameters are while you’re coding. The aforementioned Language Server will also display a red squiggle under each parameter that is of an unexpected type, hence it will notify you of mistakes like add_two_ints(2, \"lol\") while you’re coding. You can force every contributor to use type hints where they’re required by using static type checkers like pyright by running this in your code acceptance pipelines. Important question: does this absolve me from runtime parameter checking? Well, it doesn’t prevent anyone from still conjuring deamons like add_two_ints(2, \"lol\") but at least it will give them a hint if they themselves use something that comes at least close to what VSCode+Pylance can provide.\nIn the end my recommendations would be:\n👉 Use type hints aggressively. Invest ample time into learning about type aliases, hints for generics, etc. There is a lot of resources out there but if you want a fairly condensed overview, throw in a comment and I’ll share my own reference sheet. Good news: it’s so easy and intuitive that it will enter your muscle memory within a few days.\n👉 Use VSCode with the Pylance Python Language Server. It understands type hints and tells you right away when you’re attempting something you shouldn’t be doing. Or really just use any other IDE or editor that understands type hints.\n👉 If you want to be absolutely certain that whoever uses your code doesn’t pass a wrong parameter, use runtime type checking and throw informative errors to let the user understand where the error came from.\n👀 Trust me when I say this: you wouldn’t believe how many bugs having static type information is able to catch. When you’re typing for hours on end you will get tired. You will overlook things. You will get distracted. If you really want high-quality code that will be easier to maintain, use every possibility to be your own adversary and try to catch your own mistakes.\nWhile it’s lately become a controversial topic to exactly quantify how much more catching a bug in production than in development costs, there have been some ridiculous examples of bugs costing companies hundreds of millions of dollars. Pareto principle definitely applies here, putting too many safeguards into your code acceptance pipeline may actually decrease productivity if you go overboard. Type hints however gave me personally the biggest bang for the buck when it comes to code quality assurance, that’s why I am so bullish on them.\n","wordCount":"1054","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-12-17T22:26:21+01:00","dateModified":"2021-12-17T22:26:21+01:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://kjczarne.github.io/posts/seven-sins-of-python-sin-3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Chris","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://kjczarne.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://kjczarne.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Chris (Alt + H)">Chris</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://kjczarne.github.io/posts/ title=brainfarts><span>brainfarts</span></a></li><li><a href=http://kjczarne.github.io/search/ title="search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>search</span></a></li><li><a href=http://kjczarne.github.io/papers/ title=papers><span>papers</span></a></li><li><a href=http://kjczarne.github.io/cv/ title=cv><span>cv</span></a></li><li><a href=http://kjczarne.github.io/about/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Seven Sins of Python - Sin 3</h1><div class=post-meta>&lt;span title='2021-12-17 22:26:21 +0100 +0100'>December 17, 2021&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;5 min</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#sin-number-3-unconditional-romance-with-ducktyping aria-label="Sin number 3: Unconditional romance with ducktyping">Sin number 3: Unconditional romance with ducktyping</a><ul><li><a href=#whence-the-temptation aria-label="Whence the temptation?">Whence the temptation?</a></li><li><a href=#why-is-this-a-sin aria-label="Why is this a sin?">Why is this a sin?</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-recognize-a-sinner aria-label="How to recognize a sinner?">How to recognize a sinner?</a><ul><li><a href=#bad-solution aria-label="Bad solution">Bad solution</a></li><li><a href=#slightly-better-solution aria-label="Slightly better solution">Slightly better solution</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#how-to-repent aria-label="How to repent?">How to repent?</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h2 id=sin-number-3-unconditional-romance-with-ducktyping>Sin number 3: Unconditional romance with ducktyping<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sin-number-3-unconditional-romance-with-ducktyping>#</a></h2><h3 id=whence-the-temptation>Whence the temptation?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#whence-the-temptation>#</a></h3><p>Python is truly awesome.

Most analysis services like the Python Language Server in VSCode will be able to suggest you what type the input parameters are <em>while you&rsquo;re coding</em>.</li><li>The aforementioned Language Server will also display a red squiggle under each parameter that is of an unexpected type, hence it will notify you of mistakes like <code>add_two_ints(2, "lol")</code> <em>while you&rsquo;re coding</em>.</li><li>You can force every contributor to use type hints where they&rsquo;re required by using static type checkers like <a href=https://github.com/microsoft/pyright>pyright</a> by running this in your code acceptance pipelines.</li></ul><p>Important question: <strong>does this absolve me from runtime parameter checking</strong>? Well, it doesn&rsquo;t prevent anyone from still conjuring deamons like <code>add_two_ints(2, "lol")</code> but at least it will give them a hint if they themselves use something that comes at least close to what VSCode+Pylance can provide.</p><p>In the end my recommendations would be:</p><blockquote><p>👉 Use type hints aggressively. Invest ample time into learning about type aliases, hints for generics, etc. There is a lot of resources out there but if you want a fairly condensed overview, throw in a comment and I&rsquo;ll share my own reference sheet. Good news: it&rsquo;s so easy and intuitive that it will enter your muscle memory within a few days.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>👉 Use VSCode with the Pylance Python Language Server. It understands type hints and tells you right away when you&rsquo;re attempting something you shouldn&rsquo;t be doing. Or really just use any other IDE or editor that understands type hints.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>👉 If you want to be absolutely certain that whoever uses your code doesn&rsquo;t pass a wrong parameter, use runtime type checking and throw <em>informative</em> errors to let the user understand where the error came from.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>👀 Trust me when I say this: you wouldn&rsquo;t believe how many bugs having static type information is able to catch. When you&rsquo;re typing for hours on end you will get tired. You will overlook things. You will get distracted. If you really want high-quality code that will be easier to maintain, use every possibility to be your own adversary and try to catch your own mistakes.</p></blockquote><p>While it&rsquo;s lately become a controversial topic to exactly quantify how much more catching a bug in production than in development costs, there have been some ridiculous examples of <a href=https://smartbear.com/blog/software-bug-cost/>bugs costing companies hundreds of millions of dollars</a>. Pareto principle definitely applies here, putting too many safeguards into your code acceptance pipeline may actually decrease productivity if you go overboard. Type hints however gave me personally the biggest bang for the buck when it comes to code quality assurance, that&rsquo;s why I am so bullish on them.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=http://kjczarne.github.io/tags/seven-sins-of-python/>Seven-Sins-of-Python</a></li></ul><div class=share-buttons><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="share Seven Sins of Python - Sin 3 on twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?text=Seven%20Sins%20of%20Python%20-%20Sin%203&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fkjczarne.github.io%2fposts%2fseven-sins-of-python-sin-3%2f&amp;hashtags=seven-sins-of-python"><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="30" width="30" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M449.446.0C483.971.0 512 28.03 512 62.554v386.892C512 483.97 483.97 512 449.446 512H62.554c-34.524.0-62.554-28.03-62.554-62.554V62.554c0-34.524 28.029-62.554 62.554-62.554h386.892zM195.519 424.544c135.939.0 210.268-112.643 210.268-210.268.0-3.218.0-6.437-.153-9.502 14.406-10.421 26.973-23.448 36.935-38.314-13.18 5.824-27.433 9.809-42.452 11.648 15.326-9.196 26.973-23.602 32.49-40.92-14.252 8.429-30.038 14.56-46.896 17.931-13.487-14.406-32.644-23.295-53.946-23.295-40.767.0-73.87 33.104-73.87 73.87.0 5.824.613 11.494 1.992 16.858-61.456-3.065-115.862-32.49-152.337-77.241-6.284 10.881-9.962 23.601-9.962 37.088.0 25.594 13.027 48.276 32.95 61.456-12.107-.307-23.448-3.678-33.41-9.196v.92c0 35.862 25.441 65.594 59.311 72.49-6.13 1.686-12.72 2.606-19.464 2.606-4.751.0-9.348-.46-13.946-1.38 9.349 29.426 36.628 50.728 68.965 51.341-25.287 19.771-57.164 31.571-91.8 31.571-5.977.0-11.801-.306-17.625-1.073 32.337 21.15 71.264 33.41 112.95 33.41z"/></svg>
