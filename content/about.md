I have spent almost 3 years as a Software Developer at Technica Engineering GmbH with a focus on process automation, continuous integration systems and infrastructure tooling, mainly tooling for automation of hardware quality assurance. I speak Python, C#, TypeScript, Rust and F#. Also enough C++ to survive.

My original domain is Biotechnology with focus on Genetics and Epigenetics. I have a B.Sc. degree in Biotechnology and am an alumnus of Data Science Retreat Deep Learning Bootcamp. Currently pursuing M.A.Sc. degree in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo.
