# About me

I am a Software Developer at Technica Engineering GmbH with a focus on process automation, continuous integration systems and infrastructure tooling. I am currently involved in projects related to the automation of hardware testing in the automotive domain. I speak Python, C#, F#, TypeScript and to a lesser degree Rust. I despise C++.

My original domain is Biotechnology with focus on Genetics and Epigenetics. I have a B.Sc. degree in Biotechnology and am an alumnus of Data Science Retreat Deep Learning Bootcamp.
