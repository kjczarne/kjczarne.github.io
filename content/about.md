I have spent almost 3 years as a Software Developer at Technica Engineering GmbH with a focus on process automation, continuous integration systems and infrastructure tooling, mainly tooling for automation of hardware quality assurance. I speak Python, C#, TypeScript, Rust and F#. I despise C++, yet I have managed build systems for C++ projects in a commercial setting and wrote pieces of laughably bad C++ code that after several corrections made its way to an important internal tool.

My original domain is Biotechnology with focus on Genetics and Epigenetics. I have a B.Sc. degree in Biotechnology and am an alumnus of Data Science Retreat Deep Learning Bootcamp.

I am pretty sure I have Asperger's or something of that sort but nobody dared diagnose me yet. ðŸ˜‚
